    "`len(str)`: Returns the length of the string.\n",

    "\n",
    "`str.split(sep=None, maxsplit=-1)`: Returns a list of the words in the string, using sep as the delimiter. If sep is not specified or is None, whitespace is used as the delimiter. If maxsplit is specified, at most maxsplit splits are done.\n",
    "\n",
    "`str.join(iterable)`: Joins the elements of the iterable into a string, with str as the separator.\n",

    "`str.replace(old, new[, count])`: Returns a copy of the string with all occurrences of old replaced with new. If count is specified, only the first count occurrences are replaced.\n",
