    "In Python, all generators are iterators. This can be proved by the fact that generators are a subclass of iterators. A generator is built by calling a function that has one or more yield expressions and is an object that meets the definition of an iterator. Generators are a special type of function that use the yield keyword to return an iterator that may be iterated over, one value at a time."

This allows its code to produce a series of values over time, rather than computing them at once and sending them back like a list."
